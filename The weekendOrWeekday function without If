note:- javascript takes sunday as 0 and saturday as 6

const weekendOrWeekday = (inputDate) => {
  const day = inputDate.getDay();
  alert(day);
  return weekendOrWeekday.labels[day] || weekendOrWeekday.labels['default'];
  // Or, for ternary fans:
  // return (day === 0 || day === 6) ? 'weekend' : 'weekday';
};

weekendOrWeekday.labels = { 
  0: 'weekend', 
  6: 'weekend', 
  default: 'weekday' 
};
console.log(weekendOrWeekday(new Date())); //current date


// to get rid of || as it is OR operator and since we are opt to use it we can make whole days label like below
const weekendOrWeekday = (inputDate) => {
  const day = inputDate.getDay();
  alert(day);
  return weekendOrWeekday.labels[day] || weekendOrWeekday.labels['default'];
  // Or, for ternary fans:
  // return (day === 0 || day === 6) ? 'weekend' : 'weekday';
};

weekendOrWeekday.labels = { 
  0: 'weekend', 
  6: 'weekend',
  1: 'weekday',
  2: 'weekday',
  3: 'weekday',
  4: 'weekday',
  5: 'weekday',
  default: 'weekday' 
};

console.log(weekendOrWeekday(new Date('01/03/2020'))); //custom date ('MM/dd/yyyy')
